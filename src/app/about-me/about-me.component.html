    <span>
      I am a German-speaking Web Developer from Salzburg with experience in
      building web apps using JavaScript & Angular. You are welcome to visit my
      public portfolio, which includes responsive websites, business apps and
      games.

        I started my path to becoming a developer with an app where I wrote my
        first lines of code and quickly realized how much fun I had with it. In
        order to deepen my skills and start a professional path as a developer,
        I decided to train as a frontend developer at the Developer Academy.

        There I was able to quickly deepen my knowledge in several individual
        and group projects. I received regular feedback from the coaches on my
        projects and my code. As a junior frontend developer, I am now looking
        forward to using what I have learned in your team, constantly improving
        it and growing with new challenges.
